/*
 * aji.h — AnimeJaNai inference shim, C ABI (version 9).
 *
 * Boundary between the mpv filter (mingw/gcc world) and the inference
 * backends (MSVC world on Windows). Only C types and opaque handles
 * cross this ABI; CUDA/D3D11 handles are passed as void*.
 *
 * aji.dll itself is a thin dispatcher: it reads the conf's [global]
 * backend key and forwards to the sibling backend library (aji_trt /
 * aji_dml). Frame handles are backend-specific:
 *  - TensorRT: aji_frame.plane[] = CUdeviceptr per plane; cu_stream =
 *    CUstream. d3d11_device is ignored.
 *  - DirectML: aji_frame.plane[0] = ID3D11Texture2D*, plane[1] =
 *    (intptr_t)subresource index; stride[] is ignored; cu_stream is
 *    NULL. d3d11_device is required, and frame textures must be
 *    created with the SHARED + SHARED_NTHANDLE misc flags.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *  - conf mode: create with conf_path/model_dir; aji_configure() selects
 *    the active chain for (w, h, fps) per animejanai.conf semantics,
 *    building missing TensorRT engines on first use (trtexec subprocess).
 *  - direct mode: create with engine_path; a single fixed 2x engine
 *    (spike/harness compatibility).
